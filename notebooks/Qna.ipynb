    "***Describe your fraud detection model in elaboration***\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "Here, the code begins by importing necessary libraries. It loads a pre-trained fraud detection model from the 'models/fraud_detection_model.pkl' file using the joblib library. This model has previously been trained on historical data to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X_new = np.load(\"data/X_new.npy\")\n",
    "y_new = np.load(\"data/y_new.npy\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The code then loads a new dataset for evaluation. 'X_new' contains the features of the new transactions, while 'y_new' contains the corresponding labels indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent or not. This dataset serves as a test set to assess the model's performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y_pred = model.predict(X_new)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, the code uses the pre-trained model to make predictions on the 'X_new' dataset. The model predicts whether each transaction in 'X_new' is fraudulent or not and stores these predictions in 'y_pred'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_new, y_pred)\n",
    "report = classification_report(y_new, y_pred)\n",
    "conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_new, y_pred)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After making predictions, the code proceeds to evaluate the model's performance. It calculates three key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified transactions out of all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Classification Report: The 'classification_report' function provides detailed information about precision, recall, F1-score, and support for both classes (fraudulent and non-fraudulent). It helps assess the model's ability to classify each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Confusion Matrix: This matrix shows the count of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing insights into the model's performance on each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\n",
    "print(report)\n",
    "print(\"Confusion Matrix:\")\n",
    "print(conf_matrix)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the code prints out the evaluation results, including accuracy, the classification report, and the confusion matrix. These results provide a comprehensive view of how well the fraud detection model performs on the new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "joblib.dump(model,'models/new_fraud_detection_model.pk')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the code saves the model's updated version as 'new_fraud_detection_model.pkl,' which can be used for future predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code loads a pre-trained fraud detection model, applies it to a new dataset for evaluation, calculates performance metrics, and saves an updated model. This process helps assess and potentially improve the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions in real-world scenarios."

These features should be carefully selected based on our understanding of the domain and insights gained from data analysis.
